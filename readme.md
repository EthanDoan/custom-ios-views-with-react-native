An example app showing a custom native component in React Native 

Example for my article: http://almostobsolete.net/react-native/custom-ios-views-with-react-native.html

WARNING: This no longer works with the latest version of React Native which has removed the createReactIOSNativeComponentClass function in favour of requireNativeComponent. I'll try and get this example and the article updated at some point, but until then [here's a commit changing to the new method](https://github.com/almost/react-native-html-webview/commit/97ffdc4b72a3a798792e98edc9aac40a679bc729) on one of my projects on Github.
